  This project is designed to solve the problem of determining the fewest number of operations needed to generate exactly n characters 'H' in a text file, starting with one 'H'. You are only allowed to perform two operations:

Copy All: Copy the current content of the file.
Paste: Paste the content that was last copied.
The goal is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to produce exactly n 'H' characters using these two operations.
